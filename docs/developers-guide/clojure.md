# Working with Clojure

If you're really ambitious, the book [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) comes highly recommended, and it's free online. If you don't feel like reading a whole book, [Mark Volkmann's Clojure tutorial](https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/march-2009-clojure-functional-programming-for-the-jvm) is another good starting point. 

Having an in-depth understanding of Clojure is less important when writing JDBC-based drivers because their implementation is simpler -- much of the work is already for you -- but it would still be helpful to understand what things like [multimethods](https://clojure.org/reference/multimethods) are.
